## How to Play
The Simon Game consists of four colored buttons (red, blue, green, and yellow) that light up in a random sequence. Your goal is to repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order. The game starts with a one-color sequence, and as you progress, it becomes longer and more challenging.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to play:

1. Click any Key to begin the game.
2. Watch and remember the sequence of colors and their order in which they light up.
3. Click the buttons in the same order as they appeared in the sequence.
4. If you succeed, the game will add another color to the sequence.
5. Continue to repeat the sequences accurately to advance in the game.
6. If you make a mistake, the game will get over, and you can try again.
7. Your goal is to reach the highest level possible and achieve a high score.
